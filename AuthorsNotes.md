# Notes from the Author

Well Co-author anyways...


## Todo

- The `latestCompletedAt` value from the api/sessions/stats should not include timestamps from  abandoned sessions, only completed games/sessions such that the session has been ended "properly" via the API by the frontend or whatever client.
- Toaster message for when the second Vibe coder is about to spawn needs to be shown 2 seconds longer.

## Done
