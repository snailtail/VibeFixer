# Tasks: Game Intro Story

**Feature**: Game Intro Story
**Spec**: /Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/specs/011-intro-story/spec.md
**Plan**: /Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/specs/011-intro-story/plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Add intro story section placeholder in `/Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/frontend/index.html`

## Phase 2: Foundational

- [ ] T002 Draft story copy (<=150 words) covering all required narrative elements in `/Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/frontend/index.html`

## Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - Readable game intro

**Story Goal**: Place a short story between the game window and cast section.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Story appears below the game window and above the cast list on page load.

- [ ] T003 [US1] Insert intro story section between game shell and cast sections in `/Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/frontend/index.html`

## Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2) - Consistent placement and tone

**Story Goal**: Ensure the story uses a playful Scrum-inspired tone and mentions all required elements.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Story text references vibe coders, unchecked code, FOMO demon, blockers, PO, and Imp Ediment.

- [ ] T004 [US2] Refine story copy for tone and required references in `/Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/frontend/index.html`

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting

- [ ] T005 Add styling to keep intro readable and consistent with site typography in `/Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/frontend/index.html`

## Dependencies

- US1 depends on T001.
- US2 depends on T002.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T003 can proceed after T001.
- T004 can proceed after T002.

## Implementation Strategy

Draft the story copy first (T002), add the section in the correct location (T003), refine the tone (T004), and apply styling (T005).
