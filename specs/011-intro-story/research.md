# Research: Game Intro Story

## Decision: Keep story under 150 words

**Rationale**: The intro should be short and scannable before the cast section.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Longer narrative paragraph (risk of overwhelming the page)

## Decision: Place story between game area and cast

**Rationale**: This location matches the requirement and ensures players see it before cast details.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Move story above the game (conflicts with existing intro overlay)
- Move story after cast (misses the context cue)
