# Quickstart: PO Happiness Status

## Local Testing

1. Start backend: `node /Users/magnus/src/Work/VibeFixer/backend/src/server.js`.
2. Open the game in the browser via the backend server.
3. Observe the PO STATUS panel and verify mood changes as blocker count changes.
4. Confirm the PO image updates between happy/content/sad as blockers are removed or added.

## Expected Moods

- 0 blockers: Happy
- 1 to 3 blockers: Content
- 4+ blockers: Sad
